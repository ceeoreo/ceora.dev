I'm a software engineer based in Philadelphia (GOOO EAGLES🦅). Before software engineering, I was a digital marketer.

I'm really into education and exposing more people to tech. I've had the absolute privilege of teaching with organizations like [Kode With Klossy](https://www.kodewithklossy.com/) and [BSD Education](https://bsd.education/). I'm a Learner Advocate and Instructor [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/).

## Tech I work with 👾

- AWS
- Python 🐍
- HTML/CSS 🎨
- JavaScript (we have a love/hate relationship)
- Git/Github 🙃

## Non-tech Things I Like
