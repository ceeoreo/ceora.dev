If you follow me on Twitter, you know that I recently landed my first job writing code as a technical writer. I honestly can't believe that I made it here and I expected it to take much longer for me to find my first job.

My path has been really really unconventional. My journey is like the definition of untradtional. It makes me laugh when I think about it. I want to break down everything from start to finish, mostly for the sake of reflection. But I also think some people might find some value in seeing what I've done and how I've failed and still recovered. Just a heads up, this is probably going to be longðŸ˜… And there will be photos.

## Coding in High School

I didn't learn that coding was a thing until I was about 12 years old. One of my teachers played a video where Bill Gates and some random basketball players I'd never heard of were talking about learning how to code. This was interesting to me because I thought technology was really interesting. I was poor and could never afford all the new phones and tablets that were coming out then and I think that made them even more intriguing for me.

So I thought "I like tech so maybe I'll like this?" But I didn't pursue for a long time because I didn't have the resources available at the time. We had one laptop in my house that was always had a virus. I could barely get my homework assignments done.

Despite this, I never forgot about coding. Being a software engineer was always an option in the back of my mind. All this became more of a reality when I met Naya Moss during my junior year of highschool.

I told you this would be long so I'm including all the details. All of them. My junior year of highschool was probably the worst year of my life. Period. I almost failed all of my classes and my life was just a mess. I'd always been skeptical of college. It just seemed strange that 18 year olds were expected to know what they want to do for the rest of their life and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on that decision. But because I did so poorly that year, I totally let go of the idea of going to college.

I decided for myself that scholarships would not be an option. And there was no way I was going to take out student loans. I just had no idea about any of that stuff and there was no one to guide me. Then I met Naya. If you don't know her (which you should; she's amazing), Naya is an IT professional who does it all. She was the first person I'd ever met who actually worked in tech.

We met through mutual family friends and when she told me she worked in tech, I swear my eyes lit up. Here was someone who looked like me who was doing what I wanted to do. We talked for a really long time and she let me know that I *could* make it in tech without a degree. She did. We exchange numbers and email and she sent me a bunch of coding resources.

I was super motivated and hype. I was going to learn how to code! But I did nothing. I looked at her list of resources and kept putting off getting started. But my senior year of high school began and I was enrolled in some coding classes. For the first semester, we covered super basic, 90's internet style HTML and CSS. For the second semester, we went C++ and I almost failed.

But I still enjoyed it. I didn't really like C++. But HTML and CSS wasn't that bad. I started taking the idea of doing this long term more seriously. I mean, what else was I going to do? I looked into the salary range for software engineers and that made me even more determined. I could *start out* making 75k+ a year?? I couldn't say no to that.

When you're a senior in high school, everyone is in your business and wants to know what your plans for the future are. They get even more nosey when they realize you're not going to college. It's like some people are just ready to see you fail since you're not taking the route *they* want you to take. But I started telling people I wanted to be a software engineer. I finally started claiming it.

## Kode With Klossy to Digital Marketing

My aunt knew about my plans and she was watching some morning talk show and saw Karlie Kloss talk about her non profit called Kode With Klossy. The goal was to teach young girls how to code during free 2 week summer camps. My aunt sent me all the information and I applied. I was super happy when I got accepted.

The camp started in August of 2018 and I enjoyed it so much! It was funny to me how, although the camp was hosted in Philly, none of the girls in my class were actually from Philly. I was the only inner city kid. So there was a bit of a culture shock for me. But I still did well. I learned basic Ruby and modern HTML and CSS. I was able to build a website with 3 other girls. You can check out the [pages I designed here](https://codepen.io/collection/nmwmOb).

At this point, I was sure that coding was for me. When I finished my camp, I started thinking about next steps. College was out of the picture for me. My next options were self learning through online courses or a bootcamp. I thought a bootcamp would be a great option for me. I started doing research and ISO's and high tuition did not sound good to me. I was broke and my parents couldn't afford any of that either. I wasn't about to get into debt. That was the whole point of not going to college!

I finally found an affordable bootcamp that seemed reasonable in price called Launch School. The curriculum was self paced and costed $199 a month. My heart was set on this bootcamp. I still didn't have any money though. So I got in touch with Naya again. At the time, she was just getting started with her company Frauvis. She needed help with web development and digital marketing. I was too nervous to do web development since I felt like I didn't know enough. So I decided to learn a bit about digital marketing and help her with that.

Well, that sent me down a rabbit whole that took like a year to get out of. I ended up stuck in the digital marketing space for a little while. And I still wasn't making any money. After working with Naya, I landed a few digital marketing internships and still couldn't afford to pay for Launch School. I tried learning how to code through freeCodeCamp and Udemy courses. But I was never consistent. I jumped around from language to language a lot. I talked about all this in [this article I wrote]() a few months ago.

During the summer of 2019, I taught the iOS development camp for Kode With Klossy in Philly. At that point, I had pretty much lost touch with coding. I had to learn and teach basic Swift and even though it wasn't easy, I realized how much I actually liked coding. I didn't feel the same way about digital marketing. This still didn't motivate me to take coding seriously again.

I started doing some freelance work with family and friends. Again, I wasn't making any money. I kept looking for digital marketing jobs and every place rejected me. I rarely got interviews. When I did, they always felt weird and I'd end up not taking the job. It was a really stressful time and I was so broke it's not even funny.

## Udacity Scholarship

January 2020, I'm still going through the motions with digital marketing. I think I applied for a Udacity scholarship in November and I forgot about it. When I got the email that I'd be receiving a scholarship for their Cloud DevOps program, I was super hype.

I didn't know anything about cloud anything or devOps. But I was excited to learn. Getting this scholarship helped me to narrow my focus and to get started again.
