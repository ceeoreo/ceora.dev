## AWS aka A World of Stress

I've been getting into the cloud engineering space for some time now and AWS has been my main focus. There are lots of other people like me who are trying to learn more about AWS which is not easy at all.

AWS has a plethora of services available. Trying to figure out what services are the most relevant and important can be difficult. If you, like me, don't have a networking background or if you don't have much backend engineering experience, AWS can be even more confusing. And we haven't even talked about navigating AWS documentation.

AWS really feels like a A World of Stress. I don't mean to scare you away with all these things. What I want to do is cut away the confusion surrounding AWS as much as possible.That's why I'm starting this blog series called "Learn AWS With Me".
