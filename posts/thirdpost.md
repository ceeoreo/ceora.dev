As an industry focused on innovation and constant improvement, learning is something that comes with being in tech. No matter what level you're at or where you are in your tech journey, all of us have to learn new things. This is why knowing how to learn is so important.

Knowing how to learn is a topic I'm super passionate about. I'm giving an egghead Talk all about learning tips every developer should know. This post is a companion to that talk.

[Learning Tips Every Developer Should Know ](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-eggheadtalk-learning-tips-every-developer-should-know) is semi based on this article I wrote earlier this year.

In my talk, I reference several different resources that have helped me improve my learning techniques. I'll be listing all of those resources here so that you can check them out and become a master of learning. And as always, don't hesitate to add your own resources in the comments. Enjoy!

One of my favorite study/note-taking techniques is active recall. If you're interested in learning more about active recall, these two videos will fill in all the blanks for you. They even include some scientific evidence that proves why active recall is great.

## Note Taking Videos

I take my notes on my iPad. I've watched TONS of videos about how to take notes on an iPad. Here are my favorites. Full disclosure, my notes don't look like this and they never will. But I still learned a lot of effective note-taking tips from these videos.

## Music to Study to

If you prefer to study with some light music in the background, I got your back. This music doesn't have any words so it's great for studying or doing any kind of focused work.
