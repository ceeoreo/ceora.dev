## About this project

This is the repo for my personal site. I used this eleventy starter to create it.

This README is really for my own personal use since I don't think anyone will be contributing ot this. Future me, make sure to read through the future plans and follow through.

## Resources I used to build this

- [Starter](https://github.com/danurbanowicz/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate) by [Dan Urbanowicz](https://www.danurbanowicz.com/)
- [Phil Hawksworth Freecodecamp JAMstack class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_l0qrPUJds&t=3576s)
- [Eleventy Docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/)

## Future Plans

There are some features I would like to add and I'm keeping track of those here. Hopefully, future me will follow through and add them.

- Favorite posts list on home page
- Digital garden page?
  - Digital garden tag?
- Search feature (i have no idea how this is done)
- Header images for each blog post
- Speaking tab that displays talks i've done
- Projects tab
  - I want this tab to display projects with an image preview of some kind
